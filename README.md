# Dry-Bean-Classification

This project focuses on applying machine learning methodology to a real dataset for dry beans classification.

## Report Overview
The report details the essential steps taken in the project:
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Includes steps like removing duplicates, handling null values, and identifying and dropping highly correlated features.
- **Data Splitting and Preprocessing**: Discusses splitting data into train and test sets, encoding categorical data, and scaling features for better model performance.
- **Model Training and Parameters**: Covers the significance of various parameters used in the Logistic Regression model.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Includes model performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, balanced accuracy, confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-score.
